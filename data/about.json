Given the extraordinary strengths and cross-cutting opportunities spanning CEHC, DAES, and ASRC, this envisioned weather/climate science and emergency preparedness scholarly community will host standing meetings with an expected attendance of upwards of 50 or more faculty across these units. The overarching goal of this interdisciplinary collaboration will be to focus on and promote research synergies, foster knowledge exchange, promote joint publications, grow extramural funding, host research forums and conferences, and eventually build out an overall sustainable and thriving community of interdisciplinary scholars and researchers."}]
