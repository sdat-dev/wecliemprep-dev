Dr. Thorncroft’s research career has been concerned with the variability and predictability of weather systems including extremes and how they interact with the large-scale environment. His research has combined observational and modeling approaches. A key component of the proposed WISER IUCRC will be observational data provided by the NYS Mesonet. Dr. Thorncroft was the Co-PI of this weather observation network including its design and construction. He continues to serve as the Director of this unparalleled network and is extremely familiar with this unique mesoscale dataset. Dr. Thorncroft also has a strong record of supporting graduate students and postdoctoral associates. In particular, he is a passionate advocate for experiential learning opportunities for students that focus on applied research in settings with public and private sector partners. These opportunities not only provide students with exciting and relevant research projects but enable them to experience working with practitioners in real-life environments to better prepare them for the workforce.","style":"min-height:300px;"},{"type":"div","content":"<a href=\"https://www.albany.edu/cehc/faculty/eric-stern\" style=\"color:#46166b;\"><b>Eric Stern, Ph.D. (CEHC) (Co-Chair) </a></b><img src=\"https://sdat-dev.github.io/resources/weclieemprep/assets/images/Team_Members/Eric_Stern.png\" style=\"float:right; max-width:200px; padding:5px;border-radius: 50%; \"></img>Dr. Eric K.
