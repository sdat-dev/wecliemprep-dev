Bilingualism plays an important role in the processing of emotional language as well, with the native language often playing a larger role in the expression of emotion, as compared to a second language or one learned later in life.

In particular, my research embraces the cross/trans/inter-disciplinary nature of communication scholarship, with specific focus on exploring the role of communication processes in improving health outcomes among marginalized communities and promoting broader organizational and social changes and innovations in local, national, and international health contexts. I study the interaction of people involved in the health care process and the dissemination and interpretation of health-related messages by individuals, groups, organizations, and/or mass media and technology. I pay attention to how these messages are mediated through various socio-cultural, political, and economic factors.","Q23_4":"","Q23_9":"https://www.albany.edu/communication/faculty/rukhsana-ahmed","Q23_10":"","Q23_11":"","Q23_12":"","Q24_Id":"F_8jqsrZJMb3dZkEF","Q24_Name":"R_3lzTVnW3bSddJyO_Rukhsana Ahmed.jpg","Q24_Size":22567,"Q24_Type":"image/jpeg","Q31_1":"Innovative Health Communication Strategy to Combat COVID-19 Health Disparities","Q31_14":"Understanding the Experiences of Limited English Proficient Patients through the Perceptions of Healthcare Providers and Community Health Workers during COVID 19","Q31_15":"Mapping Media Representations of Refugee Mental Health during COVID-19","Q31_16":"Virtual Care Targeting Mental Health Disorders: Equity, Effectiveness, Cost, and Patient Experiences","Q31_17":"","Q32_1":"COM 659: COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXTS","Q32_14":"","Q32_15":"","Q32_16":"","Q32_17":""},{"StartDate":44356.38280092592,"EndDate":44356.385,"Status":"IP Address","IPAddress":"69.76.177.75","Progress":100,"Duration(inseconds)":190,"Finished":"True","RecordedDate":44356.38501157407,"ResponseId":"R_3EaG9NhP9juzxS3","RecipientLastName":"","RecipientFirstName":"","RecipientEmail":"","ExternalReference":"","LocationLatitude":38.96870422363281,"LocationLongitude":-94.5696029663086,"DistributionChannel":"anonymous","UserLanguage":"EN","Q11":"Jurkowski","Q12":"Janine","Q13":"jjurkowski@albany.edu","Q14":"518-209-7663","Q15":"Professor","Q16":"UAlbany","Q16_7_TEXT":"","Q17":"School of Public Health","Q19":"Health Policy Management and Behavior","Q21_1":"CBPR","Q21_8":"Social Determinants","Q21_9":"Food Insecurity","Q21_10":"intervention research","Q21_11":"urban disparities","Q21_12":"","Q21_13":"","Q22":"Janine M.
