The 6th Assessment Report from Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted the consequences of this warming, including the loss of mass from the Greenland Ice Sheet, lengthening fire seasons, increasing extreme heat events, thinning and loss of Arctic sea ice, threat of ocean acidification, and reductions in spring snow cover. The rapid and wide-scale changes occurring in response to this warming portend new opportunities and unprecedented risks to natural environments; social and cultural systems; economic, political and legal systems; and built environments of the Arctic and across the globe. Gaps in scientific observations and the prevalence of interdependent social, natural, and built systems in the Arctic make it challenging to predict the region's future. Understanding and adapting to a changing Arctic requires creative new directions for Arctic-related research, education, workforce development, and leveraging of science, engineering, and technology advances from outside the Arctic.  Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) embodies an important forward-looking response by the Foundation to these profound challenges. NNA seeks innovations in fundamental convergence research across the social, natural, environmental, computing and information sciences, and engineering that address the interactions or connections among natural and built environments and social systems, and how these connections inform our understanding of Arctic change and its local and global effects.  This solicitation requests proposals that fall within one of three tracks: NNA Incubator Grants, dedicated to developing convergent teams to carry out research projects of larger scope in the future; NNA Research Grants, aimed to support creative projects on fundamental research that address convergent scientific and engineering challenges related to the rapidly changing Arctic; and NNA Collaboratory Grants, designed to support collaborative teams undertaking research and training initiatives addressing grand challenges related to the rapidly changing New Arctic.","id":"107120","spon_name":"National Science Foundation","NextDeadlineDate":"08-Feb-2023","total_funding_limit":3000000,"programurl":"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22520/nsf22520.htm","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) ","revision_date":"29-Oct-2021","deadline_note":"","sponwebsite":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=336265","deadline_date":["08-Feb-2023"],"contact":null,"contact_tel":"703-292-8030","contact_email":"nna@nsf.gov"},{"synopsis":"<p>This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is being issued by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) to invest in innovative research that accelerates the large-scale development and deployment of solar  technology to support an equitable transition to a decarbonized electricity  system by 2035 and decarbonized energy sector by 2050.<br /></p>","id":"109572","spon_name":"Golden Field Office/Department of Energy","NextDeadlineDate":"20-Jun-2022","total_funding_limit":10000000,"programurl":"https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx#FoaId2c6d34f8-368a-44eb-ad26-de3fad66535a","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Deploying Solar with Wildlife and Ecosystem Services Benefits (SolWEB)","revision_date":"03-Mar-2022","deadline_note":"<div>The submission deadline for Concept Papers is April 11, 2022 at 5 p.m. ET.

How organisms respond to these rapidly changing conditions will have large consequences for the distribution of species over space and time, the integrity and the composition of natural communities, the distribution and the yield of domesticated crops and animals, and the incidence and the severity of pathogen outbreaks. Consequences such as these are already having major impacts on the world's food security, the bioeconomy, and the ecosystem services provided by living systems to humans. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of organismal response to climate change will improve our ability to predict and to mitigate maladaptive biological responses to rapidly changing environments and to facilitate organismal adaptation and persistence. Most climate change studies to date have lacked integration between the study of organismal mechanisms involved in the response to changing climates and eco-evolutionary approaches. This solicitation calls for proposals that integrate the study of genomic, physiological, structural, developmental, neural, or behavioral mechanisms of organismal response to climate change (ORCC) with eco-evolutionary approaches to better manage the effects of a rapidly changing climate on earth's living systems. Specific areas of emphasis include but are not limited to: integrating physiology and genomics into the next generation of species distribution models; mechanistic understanding of plastic responses to climate change; functional genomics of organismal response to climate change; the role biological interactions play in organismal responses to climate change; and improving our ability to predict how organisms will respond to climate change and the consequences these responses will have across biological scales. Proposals to the ORCC Solicitation are encouraged that build on NSF's investment in growing convergence research by developing integrative, cross-disciplinary approaches that examine the organismal mechanisms that underlie adaptive and maladaptive responses to environmental factors associated with climate change, how these responses affect fitness in changing and/or novel climates, and the genetic and evolutionary processes through which these traits originate, persist, and are transmitted across generations. Further, this solicitation encourages creative approaches to translate results of these investigations to better predict and manage effects of climate change on organisms across spatial and temporal scales and biological hierarchies. Proposals that do not bridge disciplinary components, that lack a specific focus on organismal responses to climate change, that do not relate mechanistic insights to eco-evolutionary consequences above the level of the individual, and that could normally be submitted to the \"core\" or special programs in IOS or DEB are not appropriate for submission to this solicitation.","id":"106986","spon_name":"Directorate for Biological Sciences/NSF","NextDeadlineDate":"15-Nov-2022","total_funding_limit":10000000,"programurl":"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22513/nsf22513.htm","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Organismal Response to Climate Change","revision_date":"20-Oct-2021","deadline_note":null,"sponwebsite":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=336192","deadline_date":["15-Nov-2022"],"contact":"Irwin Forseth","contact_tel":"703-292-7862","contact_email":"iforseth@nsf.gov"},{"synopsis":"<p class=\"Normal\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-bottom:10px;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is intended to support novel environmental health research in which an unpredictable event or policy change provides a limited window of opportunity to collect human biological samples or environmental exposure data.

This NOSI encourages basic and clinical research projects that 1) combine diverse expertise; 2) develop and use innovative technologies and approaches to delineate interoceptive mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, circuit, functional, and/or behavioral levels; 3) assess pathophysiological processes of interoception in the context of diseases and disorders; 4) determine the impact of interventions and therapies to manipulate interoceptive processes on health and/or disease; and 5) develop and validate predictive biomarkers, computational models, or artificial intelligence models relevant to interoception and its impact on health and disease.</span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span>","id":"101780","spon_name":"National Institutes of Health/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"07-May-2022","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-AT-21-002.html","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Promoting Research on Interoception and Its Impact on Health and Disease","revision_date":"27-Oct-2021","deadline_note":"This notice applies to due dates on or after February 25, 2021, and subsequent receipt dates through May 7, 2024.","sponwebsite":null,"deadline_date":["07-May-2022","05-Jun-2022","16-Jun-2022","07-Sep-2022","05-Oct-2022","16-Oct-2022","07-Jan-2023","05-Feb-2023","16-Feb-2023","07-May-2023","05-Jun-2023","16-Jun-2023","07-Sep-2023","05-Oct-2023","16-Oct-2023","07-Jan-2024","05-Feb-2024","16-Feb-2024","07-May-2024"],"contact":"Wen G.

Applications may be for collaborations between institutions in the U.S and an eligible LMIC or may involve just LMIC institutions if there is a previous track record of externally funded research and/or research training programs by the lead LMIC institution. The proposed institutional research training program is expected to sustainably strengthen the NCD research capacity of the LMIC institutions, and to train in-country experts to develop and conduct research on NCDs across the lifespan, with the long-range goal of developing and implementing evidence-based interventions relevant to their countries. Interdisciplinary research training that cuts across NCDs is encouraged. However, for more topical applications, the main focus of research training covered in the application must be relevant to the mission and/or&nbsp;interests of at least one of the participating NIH ICs, other than FIC, as stated by each in this FOA.
